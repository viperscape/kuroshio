# kuroshio

kuroshio streams are built using lazy-seq of nested promises. It provides a way to communicate using stream-like representations. There can be multiple producers and consumer threads working on a stream. There is an option to even read from the stream without modifying/consuming it. Values including nil can be placed onto the stream. Finally, streams can be duplicated, which can keep the head/origin of the stream intact.

> [Stream](https://github.com/viperscape/kuroshio/blob/master/examples/example.clj#L5) methods
- put! which extends the stream with the new value
- from and from! which return lazy sequences, the latter of which moves the head of the stream (consuming it); note that these can be overloaded with :force to block during a take
- take! which returns one value, consuming the stream; note that this purposefuly blocks waiting for a result
- and shift! which consumes the stream, returning how far it successfully moved

kuroshio channels are built on top of streams and make use of lazy filtering built in to Clojure. Instead of creating multiple streams dedicated to each communication channel you might need (see [stream pools](https://github.com/viperscape/kuroshio/blob/master/examples/pool.clj)), you can instead use a single stream and multiple channels filtering on that stream. Channels can send to one another, as well as a broadcast to all channels on that stream.

> [Channel](https://github.com/viperscape/kuroshio/blob/master/examples/example.clj#L34) methods
-  send! sends to a specified channel
-  broadcast! sends to all channels associated with the stream
-  from/from! and take! which are identical to stream methods

> extras
- [stream pools](https://github.com/viperscape/kuroshio/blob/master/examples/pool.clj), which are literally grouped streams; this is good for broadcasting to individual streams
- ["bidirectional" channels](https://github.com/viperscape/kuroshio/blob/master/examples/bichan-example.clj), paired channels abstracted as a single channel to communicate between two ends
- identity checks for types stream?, pool?, chan?, bichan?, chan-data? (should you want to filter channel data from a stream)

## Usage Examples

Please see initial [examples](https://github.com/viperscape/kuroshio/tree/master/examples), more to come.

## Future

I would like to abstract some things away and provide a more unified way of using the different types, hopefully preventing multiple dependency require statements
